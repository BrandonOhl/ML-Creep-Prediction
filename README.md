# ML-Creep-Prediction
# Run "Final ML program-Mar2023.ipynb"
# "ML-Co-input_xx" files are the input data files that are imported into the program.
# "alloy data compilation_UpdateMar2023" is the original database values as entered, which was split into the individual data input files.
# "CITATION.cff" is the citation file for the original data pulled to build this database
# "Master Property Sheet" are the training dataset properties reported by the program after running it.
# "new_prediction_composition.csv" is the new data that the program will try to predict/validate. If property values are known for a given 
# stress/temperature, the program will pull those values. Otherwise, type "unknown" in the appropriate cell, and the program will first predict those values using an intermediary model.
